[00:19.09] I go up
[00:19.87] To the top
[00:20.99] Of the world
[00:21.74] And then stop
[00:28.24] 
[00:22.70] And then go down
[00:23.51] I go down
[00:24.40] Until I almost get drown
[00:36.40] 
[00:25.61] You gotta tell me your secret
[00:27.23] How to win all the bet
[00:38.23] 
[00:28.50] But then you told me in bed
[00:30.33] (that) I gotta do it with what I get
[00:48.33] 
[00:37.26] "you gotta live with what you get"
[00:54.26] 
[00:44.50] I go up
[00:45.32] To the top
[00:46.13] Of the world
[00:46.95] And then drop
[00:53.45] 
[00:47.72] 光る街眺め唇を噛む
[00:49.66] And then go down
[00:50.90] I go down
[00:55.40] 
[00:52.09] Until I almost get drown
[00:53.05] 光の下けされないように
[00:55.78] 目立たぬように
[00:59.28] 
[01:02.49] Every time I feel the pain
[01:05.06] Every time I see the rain
[01:08.45] 僕はいつも土壇場で逃げ隠れた
[01:15.45] 
[01:14.75] 夜明け前の時
[01:17.64] 君は待ってくれた
[01:21.15] 眩しすぎた街ももう怖くなかった
[01:28.65] 
[01:34.28] I go up
[01:35.04] To the top
[01:35.82] Of the world
[01:41.82] 
[01:36.68] And stop
[01:37.63] And then go down
[01:38.53] I go down
[01:39.04] Until I almost get drown
[01:51.04] 
[01:40.46] 光る街に挑み唇を噛み
[01:43.57] 光の中耐え我が物顔で歌う
[01:52.49] I heard the song is calling me
[02:07.49] 
[01:55.79] To write the words on melody
[01:58.83] To find out why am I crying over and over
[02:03.83] Under sea
[02:08.33] 
[02:05.18] 笑われたなら笑い返せばいい
[02:11.58] そんなことを君は教えてくれた
[02:17.50] So we got to
[02:23.50] 
[02:18.81] Stay alight
[02:20.46] Stay alive
[02:21.74] Stay alight
[02:23.07] And let go of all your past
[02:36.57] 
[02:25.13] Stay alight
[02:26.56] Stay alive
[02:27.85] I know I know
[02:34.35] 
[02:30.48] I'm not too late
[03:08.58] 笑われたなら笑い返せばいい
[03:14.56] この先何年かかっても果たせばいい
[03:21.18] 悔しさ味わい苦味も味わい
[03:27.47] 酸いも甘いも全部飲んで生きていく
[03:35.32] Everybody's gotta pain
[03:38.21] Everybody's got a sin
[03:41.25] I find out why am I climbing over and over
[03:45.95] Mountain high
[03:47.78] さよなら君は夜にはいないだろう
[03:53.85] 朝へとつなげて今はただ踊ろう
[03:59.90] So we got to
[04:00.92] Stay alight
[04:02.59] Stay alive
[04:04.13] Stay alight
[04:05.49] And let go of all your past
[04:07.25] Stay alight
[04:08.83] Stay alive
[04:10.27] I know
[04:11.57] I know
[04:12.86] I'm not too late
